# Now here is another important concept
# Remember - 
# 1. Strings can only be operated (+,*) with strings only.
# 2. Integers cannot be operated with Strings, except multiplication(*)


A = "there"
B = "not"
C = 3

# We are going to use concatenate (add two strings)
print(A+B)

# Now lets duplicate the string
print(A*C)
print(B*5)

# We can print the type of data by using type()
print(type(A))

# Listing the data types
# 1. String 
stri = "Hey There"

# 2. Integer 
pf = 3

# 3. Float (All DECIMALS)
ty = 4.6

# 4. Boolean
ui = True
op = False

# 5. Complex (imaginary numbers) ~NOT REQUIRED MUCH
oo = complex(3,7)

# The below data types will be taught in later chapters
# 6. List (start with square brackets)
io = [3, 4, 24, "There", "Hi"]

# 7. Tuple (start with circle brackets)
omg = (3, 7, "three", "four", 9)

# 8. Dictionary (starts with curly brackets and has key:value pairs)
t5 = {6 : "threr", "free" : 3}
