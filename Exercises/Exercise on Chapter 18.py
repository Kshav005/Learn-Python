# In this exercise, create a function which will calculate the average of three numbers
# Make sure you try this by yourself, if couldn't then, don't worry!
# We got you covered, look at the solution below.





def avg(a, b , c) : 
    d = (a + b + c)/3
    print(d)

avg(1,2,3)
avg(4,5,6)
avg(10,20,30)

# Hence, the exercise is completed!
