# In this exercise, you have to take input from a user and check whether the number entered by user is negative, positive or zero
# Make sure you have revised all the previous concepts
# If you fail to do so, don't worry, we got you covered!
# Trying is more than enough! Below is the solution :D








a = input("Enter a number : ")
a = int(a)

if a > 0 : 
    print("The number is positive")
elif a < 0 : 
    print("The number is negative")
else : 
    print("The number is zero")
