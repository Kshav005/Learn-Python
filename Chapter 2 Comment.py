# By using this slash command, we can add a comment.
# These comments are not run by Python
# They just help to explain something better!

# You can use both "" (double quotes) and ''(single quotes) to mark a text 
# The text is known as string in Python

# But make sure you remember to end the text with the same quote type.
print("Hello brother')      
# This above code will throw an error because the text ended with a single quote even though it started with double quote
# Remember that a red underline means the code can throw error

print("My bro")
print('Nothing is free')

# These above codes will run correctly

# We can also write the text in multiple lines by using three single quotes
print('''A boy was in the garden
But he didn't know what to do...
So he jumped out of a mountain and started flying''')
         
# A comment can be written by using three double quotes also
"""There was a man who don't love his family!"""
