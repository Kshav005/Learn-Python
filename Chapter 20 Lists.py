# Lists are the collection of items. These are the most useful to store things in a form of lists.
# One of the most important topics of python!
# A list is created using square brackets '[]' and seperated with commas ','

name = ["There", "is", "a", "boy"]

# Printing the list
print(name) 

# Printing a certain element, we know that the elements start with 0, in python
print(name[0])
print(name[-1])

# A list is mutable, which means that elements of list can be changed
# A list can contain any data type
li = [None, True, 64, "Hello"]

# Index of an List
b = [3,      6,      7,      12,     76,     35,     22]
    #0       #1     #2       #3      #4      #5      #6 
    #-7      #-6    #-5      #-4     #-3     #-2     #-1
