# Now we are here with an important concept!
# Variables are like containers which hold values
# These variables hold these data in a form of memory

a = 232224342
print(a)    # Now we can use "a" instead of the number

# We can also use a string instead of a number (REMEMBER THERE CAN'T BE NO DUPLICATE VARIABLES WITH SAME NAME)
A = "There is a dog"
# Python is case sensitive so it takes "A" and "a" as two different characters.
print(A)

a1 = 34     # This is integer
a2 = "Here" # This is a string
b = None    # This is a None 
c = True    # This is a boolean
d = "54"    # This is also a string as it is surrounded by quotes
# These all form the concept called DATA TYPE
# We need data types to store different values in the memory
