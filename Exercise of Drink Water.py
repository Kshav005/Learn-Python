# In this exercise, you need to create a drink water reminder, in which the python sends a notification every 'n' number of seconds/hours/minutes to the user to drink water.
# Import the plyer module to use the notification system in your PC. 
# Then use you knowledge from previous chapters to create this thing
# Good luck, I know you will do it!
# If you failed, don't worry. You have came far, congrats to you for that.
# Below is the solution, try to understand it more and create meaningul programs like this in the future!
